# Student Mental Stress and Coping Mechanisms Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict student mental stress levels using machine learning techniques. By examining key stress factors and coping mechanisms, the study provides insights into student well-being and potential interventions.

## 📊 Dataset
- **File:** `Student_Mental_Stress_and_Coping_Mechanisms.csv`
- **Contents:** The dataset includes various factors such as academic workload, sleep patterns, social interactions, and mental health indicators.
- **Preprocessing:** Missing values handled, data normalized, and feature selection applied.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand the dataset, visualize trends, and identify key relationships.

### Techniques Used:
- **Visualizations:** Histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Heatmaps to study feature relationships.
- **Statistical Measures:** Mean, median, standard deviation to observe data distributions.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
The following models were implemented for predicting student stress levels:
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

## 🔬 Key Findings
- High academic workload and poor time management contribute significantly to stress.
- Strong social support helps in reducing mental stress.
- Predictive models show promising accuracy in identifying stress patterns.

## 📚 Theoretical Foundations
- **Lazarus’ Cognitive Appraisal Theory:** Stress is influenced by an individual’s evaluation of a situation.
- **Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS):** Describes the three-stage response to stress: Alarm, Resistance, and Exhaustion.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Enhance dataset diversity for better generalization.
- Experiment with deep learning models for improved accuracy.
- Implement real-time stress monitoring tools.
